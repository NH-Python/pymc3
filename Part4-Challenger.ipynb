    "On January 28, 1986, the twenty-fifth flight of the U.S. space shuttle program ended in disaster when one of the rocket boosters of the Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after lift-off, killing all seven crew members. The presidential commission on the accident concluded that it was caused by the failure of an O-ring in a field joint on the rocket booster, and that this failure was due to a faulty design that made the O-ring unacceptably sensitive to a number of factors including outside temperature.\n",

The engineers did everything in their power to explain the risks, but were overridden by management. If the 2019 *Challenger Disaster* movie was accurate, management asked the engineers to __\"quantify your concerns\"__.\n",

Unfortunately, `pm.Bernoulli` does not like probabilities of exactly 0 or 1, though they are mathematically well-defined probabilities. So by setting the coefficient values to `0`, we set the variable `p` to be a reasonable starting value. This has no effect on our results, nor does it mean we are including any additional information in our prior. It is simply a computational caveat in PyMC3. "
