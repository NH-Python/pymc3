Presentation on PyMC3 Sept. 26, 2019

The main presentation is in the ProbabilisticProgrammingPyMC3.pdf file, which refers to Jupyter Notebooks, which are live.  It should be noted that Part4-Challenger.ipynb includes static images of data plots rather than re-generating them using code (to make a clearer presentation).  If the data is changed, the plots will not be updated.

The Jupyter Notebooks are dependent on PyMC3, Aviz and the RISE presentation module, as well as on their dependencies. The easiest way to create a Jupyter Notebook server with the required software to run the notebooks is to pull a Docker image the author has created based on jupyter/datascience-notebook.

## Setting up a Jupyter Notebook server with PyMC3, Arviz and RISE

1. Make sure Docker is installed
2. From a terminal window, get a docker image from dockerhub:

      docker pull scalafan/pymc3-arviz:version_1  
      
3. From a terminal window, run the image you just pulled:
 
      docker run -p 8888:8888 -v /Users/yourhome/PyMC3Models:/home/jovyan scalafan/pymc3-arviz:version_1
 
4. Copy and paste the provided URL into your browser address bar.
   Any notebooks you create will be saved in the PyMC3Models directory.
   The host directory (PyMC3Models) must be shared in Docker, and user jovyan must have read and write privileges.
5. Enter Ctrl-C in the terminal window to shut down the notebook server.
6. You may wish to clean up the stopped Docker container:
  
      docker ps â€“a
      docker rm containername
